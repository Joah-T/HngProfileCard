        <p>
            Joshua Noah is a frontend engineer and product-minded designer who specializes in building performant,
            accessible web interfaces that combine thoughtful motion with pragmatic engineering. He focuses on
            animation-forward, CMS-enabled websites and dashboard experiences that scale from prototypes to production.
            Joshua approaches every project with a product-first mindset, prioritizing clarity of purpose, measurable
            outcomes, and maintainable code.
        </p>
        <p>
            He enjoys turning complex interactions into clear, delightful experiences â€” whether thatâ€™s an elegant
            microinteraction, a fast-loading landing page, or a data-rich analytics view. Joshua documents his process
            through concise content (short videos, threads, and case studies) to showcase craftsmanship and attract
            collaborators and clients. Outside of work, he is an avid sports-car enthusiast and a disciplined
            strength-training practitioner â€” interests that feed his taste for precision, performance, and design.

    <!-- Goals -->
    <section data-testid="test-about-goals" aria-labelledby="about-goals-heading">
        <h2 id="about-goals-heading">Goals in this program</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Ship high-quality, user-focused features quickly.</strong>
                Deliver at least two production-ready front-end projects that demonstrate best practices in accessibility,
                performance, and animation. Each project will include a short case study explaining the technical choices
                and business impact.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Deepen practical React and state-management expertise.</strong>
                Reach a confident working level with modern React idioms (hooks, context, composition) and one supporting
                library. Build a small, testable component library or pattern set that can be reused across projects.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Master front-end architecture for CMS-driven sites.</strong>
                Architect frontends that integrate cleanly with headless CMS platforms, deliver fast cache-friendly pages,
                and include progressive enhancement and SEO-friendly markup.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Demonstrate a growth-minded portfolio & content system.</strong>
                Create a repeatable content workflow for sharing project highlights (reels, threads, short tutorials)
                to attract leads and measure engagement over time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Ship a marketable prototype for a startup idea.</strong>
                Progress one selected idea to a demo/prototype suitable for early feedback and initial outreach.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Areas of low confidence -->
    <section data-testid="test-about-confidence" aria-labelledby="about-confidence-heading">
        <h2 id="about-confidence-heading">Areas of low confidence</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m deliberately transparent about the skills I want to accelerate. Current focus areas include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Advanced CSS animations and performant motion systems.</strong>
                I can deliver polished interactions, but I want to deepen my knowledge of choreography that remains smooth
                across devices (timing functions, compositing rules, GPU-safe patterns).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Backend architecture and scalable APIs.</strong>
                I understand frontend needs but am growing practical experience in designing resilient microservices and
                data models for production.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Large-scale state management and testing strategies.</strong>
                I am consolidating patterns for state that scale and expanding coverage with unit, integration, and E2E tests.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Pitching and product storytelling for investors.</strong>
                I want more polish in narratives tailored to non-technical stakeholders and potential investors.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For each gap I maintain short, measurable learning sprints combining focused projects, readings, and hands-on
            practice with regular progress reviews.
        </p>

    <!-- Note to future self -->
    <section data-testid="test-about-future-note" aria-labelledby="about-future-heading">
        <h2 id="about-future-heading">Note to future self</h2>
        <p>
            Keep shipping and protect the craft. In six months, verify these measurable wins:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two portfolio projects that show real user impact (performance gains, conversion improvements, client feedback).</li>
            <li>A reusable component/pattern library that is lightweight and easy to adopt.</li>
            <li>A public content streak: consistent, high-quality posts or reels that drive engagement.</li>
            <li>A working prototype of one startup idea with a concise pitch and early user feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When things feel busy, prioritize incremental progress and documenting lessons as short posts â€” teaching accelerates learning.
            Reserve time for fundamentals (layout, JS patterns, testing), and lean on mentors when scaling knowledge quickly.
        </p>

    <!-- Extra thoughts -->
    <section data-testid="test-about-extra" aria-labelledby="about-extra-heading">
        <h2 id="about-extra-heading">Extra thoughts</h2>
        <p><strong>Design meets engineering:</strong> My best work is produced when design constraints are treated as engineering constraints,
            and engineering choices honor the user experience. I aim to balance pixel care with maintainability.</p>
        <p><strong>Content as evidence:</strong> Content that reveals process (decisions, trade-offs, before/after metrics) converts better than final-only showcases.
            Continue producing short artifacts that explain how problems were solved.</p>
        <p><strong>Startup mindset:</strong> Begin with a narrow, testable hypothesis and iterate with real users to keep scope manageable and surface true product-market signals.</p>
        <p><strong>Tools & workflow:</strong> Favor workflows that accelerate iteration: fast local dev, simple deploys, and minimal analytics to validate experiments.
            Prefer tooling that outputs real, testable code and accessible components.</p>
